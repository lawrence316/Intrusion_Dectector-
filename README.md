## Introduction
Network security is critical in today's interconnected world. Intrusion Detector helps you safeguard your systems by identifying suspicious activities and potential threats. Whether it's detecting unauthorized access attempts, monitoring traffic anomalies, or alerting administrators, this tool provides an essential layer of defense.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Intrusion Detector continuously analyzes network traffic, identifying patterns and anomalies.
- **Detection Algorithms**: Utilizes machine learning and rule-based algorithms to detect known attack signatures and abnormal behavior.
- **Alert System**: Sends notifications (email, SMS, or custom hooks) when suspicious activity is detected.
- **Customizable Rules**: Easily configure rules based on your specific environment and threat landscape.

## Requirements

- **Python Version**: 3.7 or higher


## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/intrusion-detector.git
   cd intrusion-detector
   ```
 

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
  


## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook intrusion_detection.ipynb
   ```
   Run the cells in the notebook to execute the intrusion detection model.

2. Monitor the console output for alerts and anomalies.


## Code Overview
- **Data Generation**: Generates a synthetic dataset to simulate network traffic.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets and scales features.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Random Forest Classifier for signature-based detection.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Utilizes Isolation Forest for identifying anomalies in the data.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.
